**Facial Recognition System**

This project implements a fully functional **Facial Recognition System** using Python, leveraging advanced libraries such as `face_recognition`, `opencv-python`, `dlib`, and `numpy`. The system can identify and recognize faces from images by comparing them to a stored database of known faces. It provides tools for face detection, recognition, and annotation, making it a versatile foundation for applications in security, biometrics, and computer vision.

The system is designed for intermediate-level developers and enthusiasts interested in understanding facial recognition systems, exploring state-of-the-art machine learning libraries, and building practical, real-world applications.

**Overview**

The **Facial Recognition System** has been developed as a modular and reusable codebase. It detects faces in images, matches them with stored identities, and annotates the results visually with bounding boxes and labels. Its capabilities include:

-   Detecting and identifying multiple faces in a single image.
-   Storing and managing face encodings in a JSON-based database.
-   Annotating faces with bounding boxes and recognition details, including confidence scores.
-   Easy enrollment of new faces into the database for recognition.

This system can be used in various scenarios, such as:

-   Secure access systems in workplaces or homes.
-   Automated attendance tracking.
-   Customer identification in retail or hospitality.
-   Interactive AI applications where recognizing users is essential.

**Project Structure**

The project is organized as follows:

-   **src/**: The core functionality is implemented in modular Python scripts.
    -   `main.py`: The entry point of the system. Handles the overall execution.
    -   `pipeline.py`: Combines components to process detection and recognition.
    -   `face_detector.py`: Detects faces in the input image.
    -   `face_recognizer.py`: Matches detected faces with the database and returns names and confidence scores.
    -   `database_manager.py`: Manages the JSON-based database for storing face encodings and names.
    -   `visualizer.py`: Annotates images by drawing bounding boxes and recognition details.
-   **config/**: Stores configuration files, such as `face_database.json`, which contains the stored face data.
-   **data/**: Contains input images for enrollment and testing, as well as output images with results.
    -   `person1.jpg`, `person2.jpg`: Enrollment images for two individuals.
    -   `test.jpg`: Test image for face recognition.
    -   `result.jpg`: Annotated output image.
-   **requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies required for the project.
-   **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation of the project.
-   **.gitignore**: Excludes unnecessary files from being tracked by Git.

This modular structure ensures clean organization, reusability, and maintainability.

**Installation and Setup**

*Prerequisites:* Ensure the following are available on your system:

-   **Python 3.7 or newer**: Check the version using `python --version`.
-   **pip**: Python's package manager, required for installing dependencies.
-   **Git**: To clone the repository.

*Installing Dependencies:*

1.  Clone the repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/Anand0295/Facial-Recognition-Pipeline
    cd facial_recognition`

2.  Install dependencies:


    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

    This will install the required libraries, including:
    -   `face_recognition`: Simplifies face detection and encoding comparison.
    -   `opencv-python`: For image loading, processing, and visualization.
    -   `numpy`: Handles numerical operations for encodings.
    -   `dlib`: Used for face detection and feature extraction.

* * * * *

**Usage Guide**

*Step 1: Adding Faces to the Database*\
Add images of individuals to be recognized. Place these images in the `data/` folder and name them descriptively (e.g., `person1.jpg`, `person2.jpg`). The system will extract face encodings from these images and store them in the JSON database.

*Step 2: Running Face Recognition*\
Place the test image (e.g., `test.jpg`) in the `data/` folder. Run the system by executing:

`python src/main.py`

This script will:

1.  Detect faces in the test image.
2.  Compare them against stored face encodings.
3.  Annotate the test image with recognition details.

*Step 3: Viewing Results*\
The annotated image will be saved as `result.jpg` in the `data/` folder. It will contain bounding boxes around detected faces, labeled with names and confidence percentages.

* * * * *

**Features and Functionality**

-   **Face Detection**: Detects faces using a pre-trained model from the `face_recognition` library.
-   **Recognition Accuracy**: Matches faces using advanced encoding comparisons.
-   **Confidence Scoring**: Provides a numerical measure of recognition certainty.
-   **JSON-Based Database**: Stores face encodings and names in an easily editable format.
-   **Image Annotation**: Draws bounding boxes and recognition labels on test images.

* * * * *

**System Workflow**

1.  **Enrollment**: Images of individuals are processed to extract unique face encodings, which are stored in the database.
2.  **Detection**: The system scans the test image for faces and extracts their encodings.
3.  **Recognition**: Each encoding is compared to stored encodings. If a match is found, the name and confidence score are returned.
4.  **Visualization**: The annotated test image is saved for review.

* * * * *

**Dependencies and Tools**

The system relies on the following Python libraries:

-   `face_recognition`: Enables face detection and recognition.
-   `opencv-python`: Provides tools for image handling and annotation.
-   `numpy`: Handles numerical data for face encodings.
-   `dlib`: Supports facial landmark detection.

Install all dependencies by running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

* * * * *

**Example Output**

Suppose the system processes a test image with two faces. It produces:

1.  Annotated image (`result.jpg`): Shows bounding boxes and names.
2.  Console log:

    `Added "Alice" to the database.
    Added "Bob" to the database.
    Recognized "Alice" with 95% confidence.
    Recognized "Bob" with 90% confidence.`

* * * * *

**Best Practices**

-   Use clear, high-resolution images for enrollment to improve accuracy.
-   Ensure consistent lighting in both enrollment and test images.
-   Avoid heavily obstructed or angled faces.

* * * * *

**Troubleshooting**

1.  **Faces Not Detected**:

    -   Ensure the test image contains clear, unobstructed faces.
    -   Confirm that the face detector supports the input resolution.
2.  **Low Confidence Scores**:

    -   Use high-quality enrollment images with good lighting.
    -   Ensure faces are front-facing in both enrollment and test images.
3.  **Database Issues**:

    -   If the database fails to load, delete or reset `config/face_database.json`.
